# Data Folder

Instructions for the format of book files to be used. 

## For splitting Book files into Chapter files:

- Format for the book files: "bookno_bookinitials.txt" 
    eg: 1_ASR.txt (For the first book of the Murderbot series called All Systems Red)

- Format for the book folder for book files: "seriesinitials_Books"
    eg: MB_Books (for the Murderbot Diaries)

- Format for the output directory (optional to follow):  "seriesinitials_Chapters"
    eg: MB_Chapters (for the Murderbot Diaries)

- Format for the chapter files would follow your book files format.
    eg: first chapter of 1_ASR.txt -> 1_ASR_1.txt

- Book text: You can decide your chapter separator (eg, 'Chapter ', 'chapter ', 'Ch ', 'CHAPTER' etc.) which wholly depends on the book text. You'd also need to clean some text from the book files before splitting into chapters like the before and after details about the book, the author and their other series.
