AFTER ALL THAT, IT took me six minutes to find out the dock surveillance system had not been hacked.

I didn’t find anything. No aberrations in the logs, no anomalous deletions, no foreign code, no traces at all.

So, that’s just great.

There had to be something I was missing. Or maybe I’m just a robot with enough human neural tissue jammed in my head to make me stupid who should have stayed with the company, guarding contract labor and staring at walls.

Fortunately Indah and Tural had followed the others out to the main office to get their gear for the search, and I could have an emotion on my face in relative private.

I’d decided to stay, but I really wanted to leave.

I’d been so sure I was right.

I went out into the main office and told Indah, “There’s no hack. The surveillance system was clear.”

I was braced for something, I had no idea what. But the fleeting look of disappointment that crossed Indah’s face wasn’t it. She grimaced, and used the feed to revoke my system access.

Aylen came in from the other room, pulling on a deflection vest. “The off shift volunteered to come in early,” she said. “And Supervisor Gamila is helping with coordination.”

“Good, take all of them.” Indah glanced at me. “And SecUnit.”

Well, fine.
